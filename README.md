                                                      Matrix Classifier


This script was developed as part of an assignment for an optimization class in my math major. The goal was to create a tool to classify matrices based on their eigenvalues.


This Python script classifies a given matrix based on the properties of its eigenvalues. The matrix can be classified as positive definite, semi-positive definite, negative definite, semi-negative definite, or indefinite.
